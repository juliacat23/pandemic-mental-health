	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with mental health challenges related to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease and  to mitigation activities, including the impact of physical distancing and  stay-at-home orders.* Symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder increased  considerably in the United States during April-June of 2020, compared with the same  period in 2019 (1,2). To assess mental health, substance use, and suicidal ideation  during the pandemic, representative panel surveys were conducted among adults aged  ≥18 years across the United States during June 24-30, 2020. Overall, 40.9\% of  respondents reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition,  including symptoms of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder (30.9\%), symptoms of a  trauma- and stressor-related disorder (TSRD) related to the pandemic(†) (26.3\%), and  having started or increased substance use to cope with stress or emotions related to  COVID-19 (13.3\%). The percentage of respondents who reported having seriously  considered suicide in the 30 days before completing the survey (10.7\%) was  significantly higher among respondents aged 18-24 years (25.5\%), minority  racial/ethnic groups (Hispanic respondents [18.6\%], non-Hispanic black [black]  respondents [15.1\%]), self-reported unpaid caregivers for adults(§) (30.7\%), and  essential workers(¶) (21.7\%). Community-level intervention and prevention efforts,  including health communication strategies, designed to reach these groups could help  address various mental health conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.},

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, all of which can cause severe lung injury, respiratory distress and cytokine storm. While mortality rates associated with SARS-CoV-2 are lower than those associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, it is more contagious and spreads more rapidly than these other viruses.

Decisions on how to apply quarantine  should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological  impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are  included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological  effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors  included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom,  inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some  researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is  deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than  required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols,  and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the  public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is thought to spread from person to person primarily by the respiratory route and mainly through  close contact (1). Community mitigation strategies can lower the risk for disease  transmission by limiting or preventing person-to-person interactions (2). U.S.  states and territories began implementing various community mitigation policies in  March 2020. One widely implemented strategy was the issuance of orders requiring  persons to stay home, resulting in decreased population movement in some  jurisdictions (3). Each state or territory has authority to enact its own laws and  policies to protect the public's health, and jurisdictions varied widely in the type  and timing of orders issued related to stay-at-home requirements. To identify the  broader impact of these stay-at-home orders, using publicly accessible, anonymized  location data from mobile devices, CDC and the Georgia Tech Research Institute  analyzed changes in population movement relative to stay-at-home orders issued  during March 1-May 31, 2020, by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five  U.S. territories.* During this period, 42 states and territories issued mandatory  stay-at-home orders. When counties subject to mandatory state- and territory-issued  stay-at-home orders were stratified along rural-urban categories, movement decreased  significantly relative to the preorder baseline in all strata. Mandatory  stay-at-home orders can help reduce activities associated with the spread of  COVID-19, including population movement and close person-to-person contact outside  the household.},

METHOD: Data were collected in October, 2013. The gender,  age, residential background, body mass index (BMI), perceived family economy and  perceived study burden were obtained from a total of 4747 college students (41.6\%  males and 58.4\% females). The outcomes were self-reported PA status, ST, anxiety,  depression, psychopathological symptoms and sleep quality. Analyses were conducted  with logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 16.3\%, 15.9\% and 17.3\% of the  students had psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression and  psychopathological symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was  9.8\%. High ST was significantly positively associated with anxiety (OR=1.38, 95\%CI:  1.15-1.65), depression (OR=1.76, 95\%CI: 1.47-2.09), psychopathological symptoms  (OR=1.69, 95\%CI: 1.43-2.01) and poor sleep quality (OR=1.32, 95\%CI: 1.06-1.65). High  PA was insignificantly negatively associated with anxiety, depression,  psychopathological symptoms and poor sleep. Low PA and high ST were independently  and interactively associated with increased risks of mental health problems and poor  sleep quality (p{\textless}0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Interventions are needed to reduce ST  and increase PA in the lifestyles of young people. Future research should develop  and measure the impacts of interventions and their potential consequences on sleep,  health, and well being.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screen time among adults represents a continuing and growing problem in relation to health behaviors and health outcomes. However, no instrument currently  exists in the literature that quantifies the use of modern screen-based devices. The  primary purpose of this study was to develop and assess the reliability of a new  screen time questionnaire, an instrument designed to quantify use of multiple  popular screen-based devices among the US population. METHODS: An 18-item  screen-time questionnaire was created to quantify use of commonly used screen  devices (e.g. television, smartphone, tablet) across different time points during  the week (e.g. weekday, weeknight, weekend). Test-retest reliability was assessed  through intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of  measurement (SEM). The questionnaire was delivered online using Qualtrics and  administered through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). RESULTS: Eighty MTurk workers  completed full study participation and were included in the final analyses. All  items in the screen time questionnaire showed fair to excellent relative reliability  (ICCs = 0.50-0.90; all {\textless} 0.000), except for the item inquiring about the use of  smartphone during an average weekend day (ICC = 0.16, p = 0.069). The SEM values  were large for all screen types across the different periods under study.  CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest this self-administered questionnaire  may be used to successfully classify individuals into different categories of screen  time use (e.g. high vs. low); however, it is likely that objective measures are  needed to increase precision of screen time assessment.},

No research to  date has studied the full-range of cell-phone activities, and their relationship to  cell-phone addiction, across male and female cell-phone users. METHODS: College  undergraduates (N = 164) participated in an online survey. Participants completed  the questionnaire as part of their class requirements. The questionnaire took 10 and  15 minutes to complete and contained a measure of cell-phone addiction and questions  that asked how much time participants spent daily on 24 cell-phone activities.  RESULTS: Findings revealed cell-phone activities that are associated significantly  with cell-phone addiction (e.g., Instagram, Pinterest), as well as activities that  one might logically assume would be associated with this form of addiction but are  not (e.g., Internet use and Gaming). Cell-phone activities that drive cell-phone  addiction (CPA) were found to vary considerably across male and female cell-phone  users. Although a strong social component drove CPA for both males and females, the  specific activities associated with CPA differed markedly. CONCLUSIONS: CPA amongst  the total sample is largely driven by a desire to connect socially. The activities  found to be associated with CPA, however, differed across the sexes. As the  functionality of cell-phones continues to expand, addiction to this seemingly  indispensable piece of technology becomes an increasingly realistic possibility.  Future research must identify the activities that push cell-phone use beyond its  “tipping point” where it crosses the line from a helpful tool to one that undermines  our personal well-being and that of others.},

While there are several available measures, the Center for Epidemiological Studies  Depression Scale (CESD) is a popular assessment tool that has wide applicability in  the general population. In order to reflect modern diagnostic criteria and improve  upon psychometric limitations of its predecessor, the Center for Epidemiologic  Studies Depression Scale--Revised (CESD-R) was recently created, but has yet to be  publicized. This study explored psychometric properties of the CESD-R across a large  community sample (N=7389) and smaller student sample (N=245). A newly proposed  algorithmic classification method yielded base-rates of depression consistent with  epidemiological results. Factor analysis suggested a unidimensional factor  structure, but important utility for two separate symptom clusters. The CESD-R  exhibited good psychometric properties, including high internal consistency, strong  factor loadings, and theoretically consistent convergent and divergent validity with  anxiety, schizotypy, and positive and negative affect. Results suggest the CESD-R is  an accurate and valid measure of depression in the general population with  advantages such as free distribution and an atheoretical basis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Response times to depressive symptom items in a mobile-based depression screening instrument has potential as an implicit self-schema indicator for  depression but has yet to be determined; the instrument was designed to readily  record depressive symptoms experienced on a daily basis. In this study, the  well-validated Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression  Scale-Revised (K-CESD-R) was adopted. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to  investigate the relationship between depression severity (ie, explicit measure:  total K-CESD-R Mobile scores) and the latent trait of interest in schematic  self-referent processing of depressive symptom items (ie, implicit measure: response  times to items in the K-CESD-R Mobile scale). The purpose was to investigate this  relationship among undergraduate students who had never been diagnosed with, but  were at risk for, major depressive disorder (MDD) or comorbid MDD with other  neurological or psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A total of 70 participants-36 males  (51\%) and 34 females (49\%)-aged 19-29 years (mean 22.66, SD 2.11), were asked to  complete both mobile and standard K-CESD-R assessments via their own mobile phones.  The mobile K-CESD-R sessions (binary scale: yes or no) were administered on a daily  basis for 2 weeks. The standard K-CESD-R assessment (5-point scale) was administered  on the final day of the 2-week study period; the assessment was delivered via text  message, including a link to the survey, directly to participants' mobile phones.  RESULTS: A total of 5 participants were excluded from data analysis. The result of  polynomial regression analysis showed that the relationship between total K-CESD-R  Mobile scores and the reaction times to the depressive symptom items was better  explained by a quadratic trend-F (2, 62)=21.16, P{\textless}.001, R(2)=.41-than by a linear  trend-F (1, 63)=25.43, P{\textless}.001, R(2)=.29. It was further revealed that the K-CESD-R  Mobile app had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=.94); at least  moderate concurrent validity with other depression scales, such as the Korean  version of the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (ρ=.38,  P=.002) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (ρ=.48, P{\textless}.001); a high adherence  rate for all participants (65/70, 93\%); and a high follow-up rate for 10  participants whose mobile or standard K-CESD-R score was 13 or greater (8/10, 80\%).  CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, based on a self-schema model for depression that  represented both item and person characteristics, the inverted U-shaped relationship  between the explicit and implicit self-schema measures for depression showed the  potential of an organizational breakdown; this also showed the potential for a  subsequent return to efficient processing of schema-consistent information along a  continuum, ranging from nondepression through mild depression to severe depression.  Further, it is expected that the updated K-CESD-R Mobile app can play an important  role in encouraging people at risk for depression to seek professional follow-up for  mental health care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The  objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify  probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity. METHODS: A  criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United  States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients  completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a  mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD  self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental  health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care  use. RESULTS: A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as  criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified  that optimized sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (82\%). Increasing scores on the  scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6  Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days).  Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis  confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had  differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was  good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the  scale. CONCLUSION: The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and  assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anxiety, although as common as depression, has received less attention and is often undetected and undertreated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the current  prevalence, impairment, and comorbidity of anxiety disorders in primary care and to  evaluate a brief measure for detecting these disorders. DESIGN: Criterion-standard  study performed between November 2004 and June 2005. SETTING: 15 U.S. primary care  clinics. PARTICIPANTS: 965 randomly sampled patients from consecutive clinic  patients who completed a self-report questionnaire and agreed to a follow-up  telephone interview. MEASUREMENTS: 7-item anxiety measure (Generalized Anxiety  Disorder [GAD]-7 scale) in the clinic, followed by a telephone-administered,  structured psychiatric interview by a mental health professional who was blinded to  the GAD-7 results. Functional status (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-20),  depressive and somatic symptoms, and self-reported disability days and physician  visits were also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 965 patients, 19.5\% (95\% CI, 17.0\% to  22.1\%) had at least 1 anxiety disorder, 8.6\% (CI, 6.9\% to 10.6\%) had posttraumatic  stress disorder, 7.6\% (CI, 5.9\% to 9.4\%) had a generalized anxiety disorder, 6.8\%  (CI, 5.3\% to 8.6\%) had a panic disorder, and 6.2\% (CI, 4.7\% to 7.9\%) had a social  anxiety disorder. Each disorder was associated with substantial impairment that  increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) as the number of anxiety disorders increased.  Many patients (41\%) with an anxiety disorder reported no current treatment.  Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that both the GAD-7 scale  and its 2 core items (GAD-2) performed well (area under the curve, 0.80 to 0.91) as  screening tools for all 4 anxiety disorders. LIMITATION: The study included a  nonrandom sample of selected primary care practices. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety disorders  are prevalent, disabling, and often untreated in primary care. A 2-item screening  test may enhance detection.},

Adolescents who used social media more – both overall and at night – and those who were more emotionally invested in social media experienced poorer sleep quality, lower self-esteem and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Nighttime-specific social media use predicted poorer sleep quality after controlling for anxiety, depression and self-esteem. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that social media use is related to various aspects of wellbeing in adolescents. In addition, our results indicate that nighttime-specific social media use and emotional investment in social media are two important factors that merit further investigation in relation to adolescent sleep and wellbeing.},

Negative use included sharing risky behaviors, cyberbullying, and for making self-denigrating comparisons with others. Adolescents described three types of use in further detail including “oversharing” (sharing updates at a high frequency or too much personal information), “stressed posting” (sharing negative updates with a social network), and encountering “triggering posts.” In the context of treatment, these adolescents shifted their social media use patterns from what they perceived as negative to more positive use.

	abstract = {Adolescence is a period of major risk for depression, which is associated with negative personal, social, and educational outcomes. Yet, in comparison to adult models of depression, very little is known about the specific psychosocial stressors that contribute to adolescent depression, and whether these can be targeted by interventions. In this review, we consider the role of peer rejection. First, we present a comprehensive review of studies using innovative experimental paradigms to understand the role of peer rejection in adolescent depression. We show how reciprocal relationships between peer rejection and depressive symptoms across adolescence powerfully shape and maintain maladaptive trajectories. Second, we consider how cognitive biases and their neurobiological substrates may explain why some adolescents are more vulnerable to the effects of, and perhaps exposure to, peer rejection compared to others. Finally, we draw attention to emerging cognitive and functional magnetic resonance imaging-based neurofeedback training, which by modifying aspects of information processing may promote more adaptive responses to peer rejection. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying adolescent depression may not only alleviate symptoms during a period of substantial developmental challenges, but may also reduce the burden of the disorder across the lifespan.},

The physical distancing measures mandated globally to contain the spread of COVID-19 are radically reducing adolescents' opportunities to engage in face-to-face social contact outside their household. In this interdisciplinary Viewpoint, we describe literature from a variety of domains that highlight how social deprivation in adolescence might have far-reaching consequences. Human studies have shown the importance of peer acceptance and peer influence in adolescence. Animal research has shown that social deprivation and isolation have unique effects on brain and behaviour in adolescence compared with other stages of life. However, the decrease in adolescent face-to-face contact might be less detrimental due to widespread access to digital forms of social interaction through technologies such as social media. The findings reviewed highlight how physical distancing might have a disproportionate effect on an age group for whom peer interaction is a vital aspect of development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Social cognitive processes involved in navigating increasingly complex and intimate relationships continue to develop throughout adolescence. Here, we describe the functional and structural changes occurring in the brain during this period of life and how they relate to navigating the social environment. Areas of the social brain undergo both structural changes and functional reorganization during the second decade of life, possibly reflecting a sensitive period for adapting to one's social environment. The changes in social environment that occur during adolescence might interact with increasing executive functions and heightened social sensitivity to influence a number of adolescent behaviors. We discuss the importance of considering the social environment and social rewards in research on adolescent cognition and behavior. Finally, we speculate about the potential implications of this research for society.},

The definition of social media is evolving rapidly; the authors define it broadly to include social networks and group-curated reference sites such as Wikipedia. Facebook accounts are very common among health science students (64–96\%) and less so for professional clinicians (13–47\%). Adoption rates have increased sharply in the past 4 years. Wikipedia is widely used as a reference tool. Attempts at incorporating social media into clinical training have met with mixed success. Posting of unprofessional content and breaches of patient confidentiality, especially by students, are not uncommon and have prompted calls for social media guidelines.},
